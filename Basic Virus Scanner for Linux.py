Explanation:

    Virus Signatures: The VIRUS_SIGNATURES list contains byte patterns that are associated with known malicious files. Youâ€™ll want to replace these examples with actual signatures specific to threats you want to detect.

    is_infected Function: This function reads each file's content in binary mode and checks against the virus signatures. If a signature is found, it indicates the file may be infected.

    scan_directory Function: This function traverses through the directory tree starting from a specified root directory. It checks each file using the is_infected function.

    Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented to manage cases where a file might not be readable or accessible.

    Running the Scanner: When executed, the script prompts the user for a directory to scan.
