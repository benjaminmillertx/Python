Explanation:

    Suspicious Extensions: The script uses a list of file extensions that commonly indicate executable or script files, which are often used to deliver malware.

    Malware Signatures: The script also checks for specific byte patterns in files that might indicate malware. These signatures can be expanded based on known threats.

    File Scanning: The scan_directory function walks through the directory's file structure, checking each file for the defined malicious characteristics.

    Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling to skip files that can't be opened for reading.
